# ABC-Foodmart-grocery-store

The main goal for the group project is to design and implement a relational database that makes life easier for the client while at the same time offering new capabilities such as better/faster decisions from complex queries and interactive dashboards. As a rule of thumb, the final design should have at least 15 tables in 3NF. 

ABC Foodmart is a neighborhood grocery chain with two locations in Queens NY. They have been around for over 30 years. The new management wants to expand to Brooklyn NY with three new locations. Information on staffing, inventory, vendors, deliveries, sales, accounting, and more has been stored in spreadsheets and paper binders. Decisions have been slow sometimes, and there have been some errors but the system mostly worked okay and the company was making by. But now with the new locations, management wants a better system to handle the data and have real-time dashboards on important aspects of the business.
